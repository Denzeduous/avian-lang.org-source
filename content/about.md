# Avian: The First Behavior-Oriented Programming Language

Hello an welcome to Avian, the first programming language created for the [Behavior-Oriented Programming (BOP) paradigm](https://avian-lang.org/bop/).
Avian was made with the pillars of BOP in mind:

- Explicitness over implicitness
- Appointment
- Inheritence
- Polymorphism

The rest of this page will be done in the near future. Please be patient during this time :)
