# Avian: The First Actor-Oriented Programming Language

Hello an welcome to Avian, the first programming language created for the [Actor-Oriented Programming (AOP) paradigm](https://avian-lang.org/aop/).
Avian was made with the pillars of AOP in mind:

- Explicitness over implicitness
- Employment
- Inheritence
- Polymorphism

The rest of this page will be done in the near future. Please be patient during this time :)
